Implementation of TicTacToe in the console using Java. 
Includes things like an AI which utilizes a minimax algorithm to always choose the best move.
The User has the option to choose between Human players, and two different kinds of Computer players.
The Human players require the user to manually enter the intended moves in the console.
One variation of the Computer Player only plays random moves while the other variation only plays the best possible
moves.
